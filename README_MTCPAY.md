# MTCPAY Demo App (Flutter)

This project is a **demo client** for the MTCPAY wallet & card platform.

It includes:

- Multi-screen navigation (dashboard, wallet, cards, transactions, profile, settings).
- KYC flow skeleton.
- Add money / send money flows.
- Card details, notifications, support and legal pages.
- A simple `ApiClient` abstraction for integrating with a licensed EMI / payment provider.

> IMPORTANT: This client is only a UI and integration skeleton.
> You must connect it to a real backend / provider and perform proper
> security and compliance checks before using it in production.
